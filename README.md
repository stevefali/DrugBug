# Project Title

DrugBug

## Overview

DrugBug is a great way for people to track their medications and quickly reference helpful information about them.

### Problem

As a father of a transplant patient, I know how much work it can be to keep track when someone is on multiple medications.
I can't tell you how many times my child has wanted to try some new juice or fruit and I had to look up on Google whether it interacts with any of her medications, only to still feel uneasy about whether I should trust the sources.
Sometimes, life happens and I end up so busy or distracted that I end up late for a medicine dose time.
There can be so many things to stay on top of including:

- When to take each medicine
- Different and evolving doses
- When to order refills
- Which medications need to be taken with/without food
- Which foods to avoid
- Possible interactions with other over-the-counter drugs
- Which side effects to look out for

### User Profile

This app will be great for people who take multiple medications regularly and could use some help staying on top of all the details. Lots of people take various medications and could benefit from having reminders and a centralized place to find information specific to their medication needs.

- Seniors
- People with who take multiple medications regularly
- Nurses or caretakers of people on medication
